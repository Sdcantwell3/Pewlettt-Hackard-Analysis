# Pewlettt-Hackard-Analysis
Employee Retirement Analysis

# Overview
In this analysis I looked at all of the employees at a firm and detemeined the number of employees who are eligible for retirement and stratified them by role and level within the company. I also put together a ananlysis to determine what number of the total population is eligible to become mentors for younger staff.  I did this in hopes to get a determination of how the firm needs to focus its resources to ensure an stable future for its company.

# Results
- Of the 72,458 eligible for retirement 50,842 are in "Senior" roles.  This is a 70% retirement rate of upper management roles

- Pewlett-Hackard will be losing 25,916 experienced engineers and another 9,285 basic engineers. This represents a workforce loss of 35,201 they would need an army of recruiters to backfill these positions in a timeframe that wouldn't distrubt normal business if they don't already have a large group ready to move into these roles.

- The "Staff" group will be losing 7,636 workers, this group is likely composed of the support staff that wouldbe assisting in recruiting, onboarding, and fascilitating the engineering and technique lead groups.  This loss will no doubt be felt throughout the company by all management personel.

- With the total loss from the engineering group of 36,291 (senior 25,916, engineer 9,285, assistant 1,090) this company will need to pour a lot of resources into mentoring and training.

# Summary
The "silver tsunami" will cause a workforce loss of 72,458 employees. More concerning is that there are only 1,549 employees eligible to mentor new recruites for the positions that will see large retirement migration.  To get more insight into the issue it would be useful to inquire how many your engineers and other employees are currently employed with the company and do a assessment of how long typical employees stay with the company.  If there is a large portion of your enthusiastic employees and the company has a good track record for long term employee retention this problem may not be as serious as it seems from this assessment.
